# Reversed Cards

When the clients draws a card and it is upside down

## Means

The client has not learned the master lesson from the previous card

Can represent negative and weakest qualities of the court cards

## Why not use reversed cards

- Reversed cards turn me off the tarot
- In most cases reverse becomes a negative version or weaker version
- Suit like the 10 of pentacles - suddenly only one in 10 card is positive
