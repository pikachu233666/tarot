# The Scared Cards

All contain powerful spiritual lessons that once mastered lead to joy, happiness in all areas of your life

- THE DEVIL
- THREE OF SWORDS
- DEATH
- THE MOON
- THE TOWER
- TEN OF SWORDS
- FIVE OF CUPS

## Example

FIVE OF CUPS: Grief and Loss become a new and batter relationship

THE TOWER: The shock of losing a job that you did not like becomes a better job

Old beliefs that no longer serve you that have created weak foundations

## Tips

If fragile, or depressed, start with oracle cards featuring angles or use both together.

Tarot contains universal life lessons, but sometimes we need a more gentle approach

Wait at least 24 hours after a huge shock, perfectly longer

Add additional card if ending on one of the more intense cards
