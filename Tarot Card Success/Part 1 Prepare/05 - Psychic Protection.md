Important to do some form of Psychic Protection before doing a reading

## Protection Prayer

**Unity Church Prayer**

The Light of God surrounds me.

The Love of God enfolds me.

The Power of God protects me.

The Presence of God watches over me.

The Mind of Good guides me.

The Life of God flows through me.

The Laws of God direct me.

The Power of God abides within me.

The Joy of God uplifts me.

The Strength of God renews me.

The Beauty of God inspired me.

Wherever I am, God is!
